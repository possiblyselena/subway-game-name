# **Inspiration**

we wanted to make a multiplayer game that strengthened the relationships of those who played the games! since we’re mostly strangers to one another here at parthenon, we knew that there was no better way to connect with someone than through games 
since we’re all currently in NYC, we thought that the game should take place on the subway! (we were also inspired by real events -- our group almost got lost coming back from duolingo since we split up with the organizers)

# **the game**

lore: some creeps on the subway completely destroyed the maps you needed to meet up with fellow acolytes!
however, you know that there are three key elements when it comes to a subway map: the colour of the line, the direction of the line, and the name of stations!
in order to find eachother, you have to pass through three different levels of minigames. sounds easy, right?
the hard part is that each player sees a different perspective of the game! in order for each player to complete their own respective tasks within a minigame, each player has to effectively communicate with one another and share the information needed for another player to complete their task!

# **more technical stuff**
We used Next.js, Prisma, Neon DB for our project! Its a website-based and uses Neon's DB for user tracking and hosting game rooms!
